## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 ( Semantic, Accessible )
- CSS BEM
- CSS Grid
- Mobile First Styling Approach

### What I learned

This is my 10th project from FM & I learnt most important lesson which is ..

> Do you swim like a **dog** or **Michael Phelps** and does it really matter ?

- Yesterday I got lots of review comments on my "working code" from a ( so called ) senior / expert developer.
- Initially I felt bad about it; as I got things working and still got so many review comments.
- But then I thought, at-least I can build project perfectly ( with some imperfect code )
- Being able to swim like a dog initially and getting rid of fear of water is most important IMHO.
- Once you're confident that you can swim in a swimming pool, lake, river, ocean etc...
- ..then you can learn how to perfect your swimming strokes to cover longer distance with lesser efforts.

> In my ~ 2 decades of IT experience working as SDET, I didn't met ( in India, US, EU / Germany ) any developer who said other developer has written good quality code. Developers always use to complain that other person has written **Spaghetti code**.
